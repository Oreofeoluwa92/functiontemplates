This project implements  how we use several operations of vectors (VEC<T> and ELEM<T>) using C++ templates. 
The operations include initialization, printing, generating sequences, filtering, mapping, reducing, and zipping vectors. 


Features
Implemented Functions:
printElem: Prints a single vector element.
initVec: Initializes a vector with a given list of elements.
printVec: Prints the contents of a vector in a formatted way.
generate: Generates a sequence of values using a provided function.
zip: Combines two vectors element-wise into pairs.
filter: Filters elements of a vector based on a predicate function.
map: Applies a function to each element of a vector and stores the results.
reduce: Reduces a vector to a single element using a binary function.

The code runs on any IDE environment.Here is a link to the code
